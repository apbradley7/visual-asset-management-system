# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. See [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) for commit guidelines.

## [2.1.1] (2025-01-17)

This hotfix version includes bug fixes related to dependency tools and library updates.

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed and added Poetry export plugin library used during Lambda layer building due to Poetry no longer including "export" as part of the core library.
-   Fixed Dockerfile container environment variable formats to no longer use the deprecated Docker format. `ENV KEY VALUE` -> `ENV KEY=VALUE`
-   Fixed 3D Metadata Labeling pipeline use-case to use the latest Blender version due to Alpine APK support deprecation for earlier specified versions.
-   Fixed 3D Metadata Labeling pipeline use-case state machine Lambda to not hard-code the `us-east-1` region for IAM role resource permission and use the stack-deployed region instead.

## [2.1.0] (2024-11-15)

This minor version includes changes to VAMS pipelines, use-case pipeline implementations, and v2.0 bug fixes.

Recommended Upgrade Path: A/B Stack Deployment with data migration using staging bucket configuration and upgrade migration scripts for DynamoDB tables in `./infra/upgradeMigrationScripts`

### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

-   Due to packaged library version upgrades in the solution, customer must make sure they are using the latest global installs of aws cli/CDK
-   Pipelines are now changed to support a new pipelineType meaning, and the old pipelineType was renamed to pipelineExecutionType.
-   Execution workflow input parameter names to pipelines have also changed, which can break existing workflows/pipelines.

Due to DynamoDB table structure changes, a A/B Stack deployment with migration script is recommended if there are existing pipelines that need to be automatically brought over.

### Features

-   Re-worked infrastructure CDK components and project directory structure to split out use-case pipelines (i.e., PotreeViewer/Visualizer Pipelines) from the rest of the lambda backend and stack infrastructures. This will allow for future upgrades that will split these components completely out into their own open-source project.
-   `PotreeViewerPipeline` (previously VisualizerPipeline) is now baselined to the new standard use-case pipeline pattern to support external state machine callbacks (i.e., from VAMS pipeline workflows)
-   -   `PreviewPotreeViewerPipeline` (previously VisualizerPipeline) can now be registered and called from VAMS pipeline workflows (suggested to be called from a preview type pipeline) via the 'vamsExecutePreviewPcPotreeViewerPipeline' lambda function.
-   Added a new use-case pipeline and configuration option for `GenAiMetadata3dLabelingPipeline` that can take in OBJ, FBX, GLB, USD, STL, PLY, DAE, and ABC files from an asset and use generative AI to analyze the file through 2D renders what keywords, tags, or other metadata the file should be associated with. Pipeline can be called by registering 'vamsExecuteGenAiMetadata3dLabelingPipeline' lambda function with VAMS pipelines / workflows.
-   Added a new use-case pipeline and configuration option for `Conversion3dBasic` that can convert between STL, OBJ, PLY, GLTF, GLB, 3MF, XAML, 3DXML, DAE, and XYZ file types. VAMS pipeline registration `outputType` will define for each pipeline registration what the output file extension type will be.
-   -   This pipeline for non-GovCloud deployments is enabled by default in the infrastructure configuration.
-   **Web** Added `pipelineExecutionType` to VAMS pipelines (previously `pipelineType`) and added a new context to `pipelineType`. Current pipeline types are `StandardFile` and `PreviewFile`. These are implemented to support future roadmap implementations of different pipeline types and auto-executions options on asset file uploads.
-   **Web** Added `inputParameters` to pipelines to allow the optional specification of a JSON object which can be used within a pipeline execution to set pipeline configuration options. This is set at the time of creating a VAMS pipeline.
-   Added `inputMetadata` to pipeline inputs which automatically pulls in asset name, description, tags, and all metadata fields of the asset to a pipeline execution. This can also be used in the future to pull through user-defined inputMetadata at the time of an execution with additional UI/UX.
-   Changed `inputPath` and `outputPath` of pipeline function execution inputs to `inputS3AssetFilePath` and `outputS3AssetFilesPath`
-   Added `outputS3AssetPreviewPath`, `outputS3AssetMetadataPath`, and `inputOutputS3AssetAuxiliaryFilesPath` pipeline execution parameter inputs to support different location paths for asset data outputs and writing to asset auxiliary temporary path locations
-   Added `outputType` for user-specified expected file extension output for pipelines based on the VAMS pipeline registration. OutputType is not enforced and is something pipelines need to work into their own business logic as appropriate.
-   -   All asset write-back locations are now temporary job execution specific to allow for better security, file checks, proper back-versioning into an asset, and to start abstracting pipelines from writing directly to assets. Once the UploadV2 process is completed in a future update, direct access by use-case pipelines to S3 asset buckets will be removed in favor of API uploads / presigned URLs for storage abstraction.
-   Updated `processWorkflowExecutionOutput` lambda function (previously `uploadAllAssets`) to also account for metadata data object outputs of pipelines to update against assets. Preview image output logic is stubbed out but will not be fully implemented until the new upload / storage process overhaul is completed in a future version.
-   Added `credTokenTimeoutSeconds` authProvider config on the infrastructure side to allow manual specification of access, ID, and pre-signed URL tokenExpiration. Extending this can fix upload timeouts for larger files or slower connections. Auth refresh tokens timeouts are fixed to 24 hours currently.
-   -   Implements a new approach for s3ScopedAccess for upload that allows tokens up to 12 hours using AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.
-   **Web** Added PointCloud viewer and pipeline support for `.ply` file formats, moved from the 3D Mesh 3D Online Viewer
-   **Web** The asset file viewer now says `(primary)` next to the assets main/primary associated file. The primary file is what get's used right now for pipeline ingestion when launching a workflow.
-   Changed access logs S3 bucket lifecycle policy to only remove logs after 90 days
-   Added lifecycle polcies on asset and asset auxiliary bucket to remove incomplete upload parts after 14 days

### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed CreateWorkflow error seen in v2.0 (Mac/Linux builds) with updated library dependencies and setting a standardized docker platforms across the board to `linux/amd64`
-   Re-worked PreviewPotreeViewerPipeline (previously VisualizerPipeline) state machine and associated functions to properly handle errors
-   Fixed benign logger errors in OpenSearch indexing lambda function (streams)
-   Fixed existing functionality with `processWorkflowExecutionOutput` (previously `uploadAllAssets`) not working
-   Fixed pipeline execution to properly account for asset file primary key names that contain spaces. Previously, could cause pipelines to error on execution.
-   **Web** The asset file viewer now appropriately shows multiple files that are uploaded to the asset
-   **Web** Hid the `View %AssetName% Metadata` button for top-level root folder on asset details page file manager that led to a blank page. The metadata for this is already on the asset details page.
-   Fixed GovCloud deployments where v2 Lambda PreTokenGen for Cognito are not supported, reverted to v1 lambdas that only support Access Tokens (instead of both ID and Access token use for VAMS authorizers)
-   Fixed GovCloud deployments for erronouesly including a GeoServices reference that is not supported in GovCloud partition
-   Fixed KMS key IAM policy principals (for non-externally imported key setting) to include OpenSearch when using OpenSearch deployment configurations
-   Added logic to look at other claims data if "vams:\*" claims are not in the original JWT token. This is in prepartion for external IDP support and some edge case setups customers have.
-   Fixed CDK deployment bug not deploying the required VPC endpoints during particular configurations of OpenSearch Provisioned, Not using all Lambda's behind VPCs, and using the option to use VPC endpoints
-   **Web** Fixed bug where adding asset links had swapped the child/parent asset (WebUI only bug, API direct calls were not affected)
-   Fixed CDK deployment bug of encrypting the WebAppLogsBucket when deploying with ALB and KMS encryption. The WebAppLogsBucket cannot be KMS encrypted when used for ALB logging output.
-   Fixed bug for exceeding PolicyLimitSize of STS temporary role calls in S3ScopedAccess used during asset upload from the Web UI when KMS encryption is enabled.
-   Increased CustomResource lambda timeouts for OpenSearch schema deployment that caused issues intermitently during GovCloud deployments
-   Fixed bug in constraint service API that was saving constraints on POST/PUT properly but was erroring on generating a 200 response resulting in a 500 error
-   Fixed bug in OpenSearch indexing (bad logging method) during certain edge cases that prevented adding new data to the index
-   Fixed bug in CDK storageResource helper function where S3 buckets were not getting the proper resource policies applied

### Chores

-   VisualizerPipeline now re-named to PreviewPotreeViewerPipeline as the previous name was too generic and other "visualizer" or viewer pipelines may exist later
-   'visualizerAssets' S3 bucket renamed to 'assetAuxiliary'. This bucket will now be used for all pipeline or otherwise auto-generated files (previews/thumbnails) associated with assets that should not be versioned
-   'visualizerAssets/{proxy+}' API route and related function re-named to 'auxililaryPreviewAssets/stream/{proxy+}'. This function is used for retrieving auto-generated preview files that should be rapidly streamed such as the PreviewPotreeViewerPipeline files.
-   Renamed and moved `uploadAllAssets` lambda function handler. It is now `processWorkflowExecutionOutput` and moved to the `workflows` backend folder
-   Updated Workflow ListExecutions to write stopDate, startDate, and executionStatus back to DynamoDB table after an SFN fetch where the execution has stopped. This is done for performance / caching reasons.
-   Workflow executions are now limited to only 1 active running execution per workflow per asset. This helps prevent workflows from globbering each other and preventing other errors and race conditions
-   Updated a pipeline's default taskTimeout to 24 hours and taskHeartBeat to 1 hour unless otherwise specified. Previously, it defaulted to the service default which was up to a year. This helps prevent runaway asynchronous processes that never properly return and closeout workflow executions.
-   Added some external sfn token heartbeats into the new and existing use-case pipeline implementations at the end of a container run. These heartbeat locations can still be improved, but it is expected that these pipelines take longer to run.
-   Workflow executions now pass the originating execution caller's username and request context, which can be used for lambda cross-call logic
-   Created an additional Casbin API check abstraction function which can be used to consolidate API permission check logic and simplify lambda handlers. Applied to all existing API-gateway accessible lambda handlers
-   Added CDK Stack output to display all VAMS Pipeline Lambda function names for all activated use-case pipelines that can be registered within the VAMS.
-   Added error for all use-case pipeline lambdas if executed with the wrong task_token / call-back setup (synch vs asynch) in VAMS
-   Added draft lambda functions for the uploadV2 feature expected. Draft function not yet ingested into CDK for deployment.
-   Added security.txt file to website for AWS security reporting information.
-   Updated documentation on security, legal, and use notices.

### Known Oustanding Issues

-   Using s3ScopedAccess for Upload (currently in use by VAMS WebUI) can also cause synchronization issues due to race conditions between uploading and calling the asset upload APIs. Additionally handling very large file uplaods and downloads (+1TB) can cause issues. Expect a future re-write to use solely pre-signed storage URLs for upload and a 3/4-step guided API call process for this to resolve this issue, similar to `ingestAsset` API used to test the core of this new method.

## [2.0.0] (2024-6-14)

This major version represents an overhaul to the CDK constructs to support more scalable deployment configurations with many additional CDK deployment features. It adds a new VAMS permission system with new Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) systems. Lastly, the overhaul has added business logic features to support new data structures around asset storage.

Recommended Upgrade Path: A/B Stack Deployment with data migration using staging bucket configuration and upgrade migration scripts for DynamoDB tables in `./infra/upgradeMigrationScripts`

### Highlights

1. **CDK Infrastructure Overhaul**: This release represents a major overhaul of the CDK constructs, splitting the core logic into multiple nested stacks to support more scalable deployment configurations.
2. **Configuration System**: A new CDK configuration system has been introduced using `config.json` and `cdk.json` files. Many previously implemented features, such as OpenSearch or Location Services, can now be turned on or off.
3. **New Configuration Options**: Numerous new configuration options have been added, such as VPC/subnet management, Application Load Balancer (ALB) static web support instead of CloudFront, KMS encryption, OpenSearch configurations (including the ability to turn off OpenSearch), and more. These options can be toggled based on specific deployment requirements.
4. **Security Controls**: A major aspect of this release focuses on security tightening and controls. Implementers will now be able to deploy across AWS partitions, including GovCloud, and have more control over WAF, FIPS, Lambdas in VPCs, and Docker SSL Proxy configurations.
5. **New Access Control System**: A new Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system has been implemented, replacing the previous Cognito group-based access control. This provides fine-grained access control to various VAMS resources.
6. **Asset Tagging and Linking**: A new mechanism for adding tags and tag types to assets has been introduced, along with the ability to create parent/child and related-to links between assets within the same database.
7. **Image and PointCloud Viewers**: Support for Image and PointCloud file visualizations has been added, including an infrastructure data pipeline to support viewer conversions for LAS, LAZ, and E57 input formats.
8. **Upgraded File Manager**: The web assets viewer has a new file manager UI/UX for viewing asset files and provides functionality for uploading multiple asset files within folders.
9. **Email Subscription System**: A new email subscription system has been implemented which allows VAMS users to subscribe to various data changes. Asset data objects are the first to be implemented as part of this version to allow users to receive notifications when new asset file versions are uploaded.
10. **Performance and Bug Fixes**: Various performance improvements and bug fixes have been implemented, including API input validations, optimizations for OpenSearch indexing, log group naming, unique resource naming, and workflow execution handling.
11. **Deprecations and Removals**: SageMaker pipeline types have been removed to focus development efforts on Lambda pipelines.

### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

-   **Possible break** CDK configuration and feature switch system using `./infra/config/config.json` file. Some backwards compatibility with existing CDK deployment commands.
-   CDK overhaul to split core logic into 10+ nested stacks means that an in-place upgrade for existing stack deployments is not possible, use A/B deployment.
-   Lambdas converted into inline code functions with layers (away from Lambda ECR-backed containers).
-   (SEO breakage) Switch Web infrastructure to use React hash router instead of web router to support ALB configuration option, which breaks search engine optimizations (SEO).
-   New ABAC/RBAC systems will require new roles and constraints to be set up to allow application access. Existing Cognito groups will no longer be recognized, and user memberships must be transferred to the role and constraint mechanisms.
-   SageMaker is no longer a pipeline type available. Existing SageMaker pipelines should be converted to be executed from a lambda pipeline.
-   Restrict VAMS workflow pipelines to only have permission to lambdas that contain `vams` in the function name by default. If you have external pipeline lambdas, please add invoke permissions for them to the appropriate workflow execution role or update your lambda function name to contain `vams`.
-   Pipelines created using the default lambda artifact sample will now need to be re-created and re-inserted into workflows due to using different database fields to store the name of these.
-   `/assets/all` (PUT) API call is deprecated in favor of using the existing `/assets` (PUT) and the newer `/ingestAsset` (POST) API.
-   Previously created workflows of pipelines that had pipeline nodes that didn't use `wait_for_callback` need to be re-created/re-saved from the VAMS UI or modified in the AWS Console to remove `TaskToken.$` from node tasks parameters if there is no callback on that node.
-   API response bodies for data retrieval calls that return several records have been standardized to `responseBody: {message: {Items, NextToken}}`.

### Features

-   Implement CDK configuration system using `./infra/config/config.json` file.

-   -   -   Added implementation of LoadContext Deployment configuration to support VPC context loading before main deployment.
-   -   Support an option for auto-adding*new VPC endpoints based on other configuration switches (*with some exceptions in particular configurations that will still auto-add regardless of this flag).
-   -   Support putting all deployed lambdas behind VPC (FedRamp best practices for GovCloud).
-   Implement ALB configuration option for static WebApp delivery (replaces CloudFront when enabled).
-   -   Requirement Note: ALB tied to a registered domain that must be provided.
-   -   Support WAF (if used) to deploy globally or regionally based on ALB/CloudFront deployments.
-   -   Support for using public private subnets for ALB.

-   -   Support new key generation on stack deploy.
-   -   Support option for external CMK key import instead of new key generation.
-   -   Disable all KMS CMK keys use implemented previously when configuration feature disabled (e.g., S3 bucket SNS notification queues). Uses default/AWS-managed encryption when KMS CMK disabled.
-   Implement OpenSearch provisioned, serverless, or no (neither serverless nor provisioned enabled) open search configuration options; No open search will disable VAMS asset search functionality.
-   Implement location service configuration option and feature switch (existing location service functionality, ability to now toggle off).

-   Implement point cloud visualization configuration option (existing pipeline functionality, ability to now toggle off through configuration file).
-   Add VAMS upgrade migration scripts to support A/B deployments and data migration between stack deployments in `./infra/deploymentDataMigration`.
-   (Future Full-Implementation) Implement authentication provider configuration option and feature switch. Note: Currently, only the Cognito `useSaml` configuration flag is observed (moved from `saml-config.ts` file), other auth types will cause an unimplemented error.
-   Implement new initial ABAC/RBAC access control systems to allow for fine-grained access to various VAMS resources (built on the Casbin open-source library).
-   -   ABAC defines the primary constraints and access controls.
-   -   -   ABAC currently supports resources of Databases, Assets, and "APIs".
-   -   -   **Note** Databases and Assets control primary VAMS storage resources. APIs control access to top-level system functionality (administrative pages, pipelines/workflows, etc.).
-   -   RBAC roles map to ABAC constraints to allow for backward compatibility with role/group-based access systems.
-   -   ABAC constraints can also map directly to users if organizations choose to go solely with the ABAC system.
-   -   Removed the previous Cognito group and constraint system.
-   -   -   **Note** Starts to reduce dependency on Cognito functionalities.
-   -   Created default admin role and constraint groups on new VAMS deployment. Stack deployment user will be auto-added to this new role group.
-   -   All lambdas now check access against the new ABAC constraints system.
-   -   **Web** Allowed Web routes controlled by ABAC constraints.
-   -   **Web** Administrative UI pages to support roles, role membership, constraints, and constraint membership modifications.
-   Implement new tag and tag type mechanism for adding additional information on assets (tags/tag types are currently global across all databases).
-   -   **Note** Requirement that Tags must have a tag type assigned.
-   -   **Web** Ability to search tags on assets on the asset search page.
-   -   **Web** Ability to assign/unassign tags to assets on asset creation and asset editing pages.
-   -   **Web** Administrative UI pages to support system tag and tag type modifications.
-   Implement asset linking functionality to support parent/child and related-to links between assets in the same database. Limit set to 500 of any asset link types per asset.
-   -   **Web** Ability to add/remove links to assets on asset creation and asset editing pages.
-   Implement asset email notification subscriptions on asset modification.
-   -   **Note** Users must confirm the subscription for each asset subscribed to in their inbox due to the current SNS topic implementation method.
-   -   **Web** Ability to add/remove user subscription to an asset on the asset viewing page.
-   -   **Web** Administrative UI pages to support global asset email list changes.
-   Enhance asset ingestion API to support better pushing of assets from external systems into VAMS.
-   -   **Note** The current implementation does not yet support API Key implementation for authentication and must still have a JWT authentication token to validate the calling system.
-   -   **Web** Administrative UI debug pages to allow organization administrators to call the API with various JSON payload inputs from the VAMS webpage.
-   **Web** Added PointCloud viewer support with Potree Viewer and an optional infrastructure pipeline configuration option for Potree conversions for .laz, .las, and .e57 file types uploads.
-   The AssetName field now has a new restriction to only support up to 256 characters with the following regex: `^[a-zA-Z0-9\-._\s]{1,256}$`.
-   Email user IDs now follow the new restriction to only support the following regex: `^[\w\-\.\+]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4}$`.
-   Implement Cognito client USER_PASSWORD_AUTH configuration option as `useUserPasswordAuthFlow` for organizations who cannot perform SRP calculations on some of their VAMS integrations. By default, this configuration option is set to false.
-   Upgrade Cognito to insert VAMS claims tokens into both ID and Access tokens, which helps with confusion on 500 service errors when using the Cognito access token for API authentication.
-   **Web** Add a new file manager viewer on the view asset page to provide a better visualization and upload experience for multiple files and folders.
-   **Web** Add a new Image viewer for image type assets (non-preview files). Preview images are still supplemental on image asset files, which can be used for thumbnails, as an example.

### Bug Fixes

-   OpenSearch indexes now properly update when asset details are changed.
-   Change certain log group names to add the `/aws/vendedlogs` prefix to fix the issue of reaching the maximum CloudWatch policy character count on AWS accounts with many current/past resource deployments.
-   Fix the unique name generator for certain resources to fix character count limit issues and be more deterministic across VAMS (re-)deployments.
-   Added additional parameter input validations for API calls and fixed various 500 service errors based on malformed requests.
-   Fix workflow execution bug that caused errors across all workflow executions that didn't use the `wait_for_callback` flag in a lambda pipeline. This bug fix requires the re-creation/re-saving of all applicable workflows from the VAMS UI or manual adjustment in the AWS Console of created state machines to remove `TaskToken.$` from tasks parameters if there is no callback. This error was due to an AWS Step Functions service logic change.
-   Fixed OpenSearch query parameters to discard `#deleted` assets during the OpenSearch query and not just as a post-processing step. This should help prevent inconsistent results when wanting to limit search results to a single or a handful of total records.
-   Fixed OpenSearch asset searching to look at the passed-in searchbar 'query' value and properly search across all asset indexed fields (including all asset metadata). Previously, this did not work at all and just returned all results, all the time.

### Chores

-   Renamed VAMS stack to 'VAMS core' and changed the overall user-stack naming scheme, updated resource naming across the board to meet the new CDK construct rebuild
-   Upgraded lambdas and custom resources to use Python 3.10 and NodeJS 18_X runtimes
-   -   Consolidated runtime container deployment constant to the code configuration file
-   Broke up CDK constructs into 10+ nested stacks for scalability, compartmentalization, and fixing stack resource limit constraints
-   -   Restructured the infra folder to meet the new nested stack and constructs breakup
-   Converted lambdas into inline code functions with layers (away from Lambda ECR-backed containers)
-   -   Split lambdas into 2 layers depending on dependency package need. This reduces deployment sizes per lambda and improves runtime performance.
-   -   Added lambda layer package reduction logic to remove test/cache data in dependencies to further reduce layer MB size
-   -   Updated/Added backend folder structure and yarn packages to support new inline support and layer support
-   Used the 'esbuild' package library instead of docker for any NodeJS lambda deployment packaging
-   **Web** Switched Web infrastructure to use React hash router instead of web router to support the ALB configuration option
-   -   **Web** Added hash route deduplication code to help prevent/notify of possible link/navigate improper usage with `#` link prefixes
-   Switched CloudFront to use OAC instead of OAI for better security and functionality support for S3 origin support
-   Implemented Service ARN/Principal switcher and constants file to support different AWS partition, region, and FIPS use deployments
-   -   Introduced the genEndpoints script to update the service ARN/principal constants file. Note: Does not have all services, so some have to be added manually back to the constants file. Use with caution.
-   Switched Pipeline Visualizer lambdas to look at the "Add Lambdas to VPC" configuration flag to determine if they are in a VPC
-   Added all-around error checking and various deployment warnings on the CDK infrastructure configuration system flags
-   Modified the stagingBucket configuration tree entry to allow for future upgrades to support more different types of staging buckets
-   **Web** Removed file viewer options from the main web menu as they don't fit with the application web flow anymore
-   Updated CDK deployment outputs to match configuration options
-   Updated prettier/lint ignore files to ignore certain configuration and CloudFormation template files
-   Updated documentation/diagrams for configuration/environment/deployment modes along with different edge-case scenario deployments such as HTTPS SSL proxy certificate support
-   -   Updated pricing information for various configuration modes
-   Updated documentation to support the new outlined features
-   Added Casbin@1.34.0 (Apache-2 License) backend library package to dependency files
-   Restricted workflow pipelines to only have permission to lambdas that contain `vams` in the function name by default
-   Workflow pipelines created using the default lambda will now generate with a part-randomized string name to prevent same-name overlap
-   -   Note: Pipelines created using the default lambda artifact sample will now need to be re-created and re-inserted into workflows due to using different database fields to store the name of these.
-   Workflows created will now generate a state machine with a part-randomized string name to prevent same-name overlap
-   Added file extension and MIME content type checks on various upload and download file APIs. Currently checking for execution or script files which will be unallowed from VAMS.
-   Fixed the asset download API (and modified some of the parameters) which previously was not working, limited s3 scoped access STS call permissions to only be able to upload files. Expect the scoped s3 call to go away entirely as upload/download is revamped in future updates.
-   Added pagination query params and max limits to all API data fetches that don't return single item results. This also standardizes the response bodies to `responseBody: {message: {Items, NextToken}}`. This should allow VAMS to grow into a larger system that can support more than 1500 assets/records.
-   -   **Web** Added client-side pagination aggregation of total results. Full REACT page view with dynamic fetching not yet implemented.
-   **Web** Changed the front-end to use the download API for generating Presigned URLs instead of using the Amplify client logic with s3ScopedAccess
-   -   Starting to phase out s3ScopedAccess by reducing permissions and logic depending on it from the Amplify/client side. Expect full deprecation of this in the future.
-   **Web** Updated the 3D Model Viewer package to v0.12.0 and related dependencies
-   **Web** File model viewer now looks at a separate constants variable for file types to use with 3D Online Viewer (<https://github.com/kovacsv/Online3DViewer>)
-   -   **Note** This allows customers who wish to accept the opencascade LPGL license to view some CAD formats. These file types are excluded by default. See the documentation on how to enable.

### Deprecation / Feature Removal

-   SageMaker pipeline types have been removed from the available pipelines to run. Existing SageMaker pipelines should now be called via a lambda execution layer. This is due to better security implementation and the focusing of development efforts on lambda executions which can launch any other needed service.
-   The `/assets/all` (PUT) API call is deprecated in favor of using the existing `/assets` (PUT) and the newer `/ingestAsset` (POST) API. Backend business logic code for generating lambda components remains for use in the workflow API currently.
-   The S3 `bucket` field is no longer a needed input or response field for working with asset APIs. The bucket will now be fetched from environment variables instead, based on solution permissions.

### Known Outstanding Issues

-   Although v2 split the monolithic stack architecture from v1.5 and below into nested stacks, CDK deployment warnings may show up with certain configuration option combinations that the maximum resource count for the API nested stack is approaching the maximum limit (1000).
-   Uploading of asset files from the UI can cause time-outs if files are too large or networks are too slow due to the current hard limitation of 1 hour STS credentials using the s3ScopedAccess method. Using s3ScopedAccess can also cause synchronization issues due to race conditions between uploading and calling the asset upload APIs. Expect a future re-write to use solely pre-signed storage URLs for upload and a 3/4-step guided API call process for this to resolve this issue, similar to `ingestAsset` API used to test the core of this new method.
